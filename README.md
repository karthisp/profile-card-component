## My process

1. Firstly I created a wireframe of the given design to come up with the HTML layout 
2. Then write down the possible html and css code on a paper
3. Tried figuring out how I can use the svgs to set as background
4. Made sure the html and css code is valid

### Built with
* HTML
* CSS

### What I learned
* I learnt how to work with SVGs for setting vibrant backgrounds for a web page
* Saw the benifits of using 'em' units for responsive layouts
